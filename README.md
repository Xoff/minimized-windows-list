minimized-windows-list

A Gnome-Shell extension which adds an icon to the top panel showing a list of minimized 
windows. The list contains all minimized windows on all workspaces. The windows on the 
active workspace are listed first. Clicking on a menu item restores the window and jumps 
to the workspace it is on.
